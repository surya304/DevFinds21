# Pixels to Point

To convert `pixel` to `point` in HTML, you can use the following formula:

**point** = **pixel_value** * (**72** / **96**)

This formula converts pixels to points using a standard conversion rate of `72 points` per inch and a default screen resolution of `96 pixels` per inch.

For example, to convert a pixel value of 16 to points, you would use the following calculation:

point = 16px * (72 / 96) = 12pt

You can use the point unit in your HTML by specifying it in your CSS styles or inline styles, like this:

```css {{ title: 'CSS Style Sheet' }}
.my-element {
  font-size: 12pt;
}
```

```html {{ title: 'HTML Code' }}
<div style="font-size: 12pt;">My text goes here</div>
```

**Note:** `point` unit is primarily used for print design and is not well supported on the web. 

It's generally recommended to use `pixels` or other relative units (such as `em` or `percentage`) for font sizes and dimensions on the web.
